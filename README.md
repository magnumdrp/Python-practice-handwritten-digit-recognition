# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Keras

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using Keras, a high-level neural networks API, with TensorFlow as the backend. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify digits (0-9) written by hand.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits. We utilize the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits. The model will be trained to recognize these digits and make predictions on unseen images.

### Libraries and Tools

- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for building and training the model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend engine for Keras.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing (e.g., resizing, reshaping images).
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.
- **Random**: For random operations (e.g., to shuffle or sample data).
- **OS**: For interacting with the file system (e.g., loading images from files).
